He looks like a solid QB\u00bd for 2025.</li> <li>Running Backs:<ul> <li>D'Andre Swift had a good season with the Eagles, but his contract situation for 2025 will be key. He's an UFA.</li> <li>Brian Robinson Jr. is a decent volume back but lacks explosive upside.</li> <li>Jaylen Warren is a strong PPR option, especially if Najee Harris leaves or struggles.</li> <li>Ty Chandler showed flashes but will face competition.</li> <li>Blake Corum is a rookie who hasn't played an NFL snap yet. His value will depend entirely on his draft capital and landing spot in the 2025 NFL Draft.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Tight End: Trey McBride had a breakout year and looks like a top-tier TE for 2025.</li> <li>Wide Receivers:<ul> <li>CeeDee Lamb is an elite, top-5 fantasy WR.</li> <li>Puka Nacua was a sensation in his rookie year and is a high-end WR\u00bd.</li> <li>DK Metcalf is a boom-or-bust WR2, still capable of big games.</li> <li>Drake London possesses immense talent but is highly dependent on QB play for the Falcons. Monitor their QB situation closely.</li> <li>Jaxon Smith-Njigba had an up-and-down rookie year but has high potential. Could take a step forward in year two.</li> <li>Jakobi Meyers is a reliable slot receiver, especially in PPR, but has a limited ceiling.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Kicker &amp; D/ST: These positions are highly streamable and generally not worth holding onto during the offseason.</li> <li>IDP (Individual Defensive Players):<ul> <li>Zaire Franklin is a tackle machine, excellent in IDP leagues.</li> <li>Maxx Crosby is an elite pass rusher, valuable for sacks.</li> <li>Aidan Hutchinson is a rising star on the defensive line, also great for sacks.</li> <li>Brian Branch showed promise as a rookie DB, good for tackles and pass deflections.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Monitor Offseason News:</p> <ul> <li>Free Agency (March 2025): Where do players like D'Andre Swift land? Which teams sign big-name QBs that could impact WRs like Drake London?</li> <li>NFL Draft (April 2025): Where does Blake Corum get drafted? Do the Chiefs draft a new RB that impacts Swift if he were to sign there? Do the Falcons draft a QB, or sign one?</li> <li>Coaching Changes: New offensive coordinators can significantly alter player usage and fantasy value.</li> <li>Injuries: Keep an eye on any players from your roster who might be recovering from late-season injuries.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Waiver Wire/Trade Targets: These concepts are irrelevant during the offseason. Instead, focus on Dynasty/Keeper League considerations if your league allows it, assessing which players are worth retaining or trading for future draft capital.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["fantasy-football","analysis","2025-season"]},{"location":"reports/2025/08/22/fantasy-football-analysis-2025-08-22/#3-identify-any-underperforming-players-on-my-team-for-2024-or-projecting-for-2025","title":"3.

His efficiency can be a concern.</li> <li>Ty Chandler: Had a few good weeks but often struggled for consistent touches/production.</li> <li>Drake London: While talented, his fantasy output was often stifled by poor QB play in Atlanta. If the Falcons don't get a significant QB upgrade in 2025, he might continue to underperform his talent.</li> <li>Jaxon Smith-Njigba: As a rookie, he didn't quite live up to his draft hype, often behind Metcalf and Lockett in targets.

Could you trade for draft picks if you have too many aging assets, or trade picks for proven talent?</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Redraft League Strategy for 2025:</p> <ul> <li>Early Draft Prep: Start following mock drafts, rookie profiles, and free agency moves to get a sense of player values for the next season.</li> <li>Target Upside: Your team has a good mix of established stars and high-upside players (Nacua, McBride, JSN). Continue to prioritize players with pathways to significant target shares, clear starting roles, and high-volume opportunities.</li> <li>QB/TE Strategy: Love and McBride are a strong core. You might be able to wait on QB if Love is your guy, but having a top-tier TE is a distinct advantage.</li> <li>RB Diversity: You have a mix of power backs and PPR backs. Watch the offseason carefully for any changes to backfields (draft picks, free agency signings) that could impact Swift, Robinson, or Warren.</li> <li>WR Depth: Lamb and Nacua are excellent. Metcalf, London, and JSN provide good depth with varying levels of risk/reward.</li> <li>Draft Position Consideration: Think about how your league's draft order for 2025 might impact your strategy.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Stay Informed: Follow reputable fantasy football news sources, podcasts, and analysts throughout the offseason.

Evaluation of Your Team's Performance in Week 22: *   Performance: Your team scored 0.00 points, which is the lowest possible score. However, this is not due to poor play but because, most likely, no NFL games were being played that count for fantasy purposes in Week 22. All your players were inactive for fantasy scoring, as expected if the season is over. *   Conclusion: This is not a \"good\" or \"poor\" performance in a competitive sense; it's the expected outcome for a week where fantasy football scoring is no longer active. If, by some extremely rare and unusual league setting, Week 22 was an active scoring week, then a 0.00 performance would be disastrous, indicating either all your players were on bye/injured/benched (unlikely for an entire roster) or you had an empty roster (also unlikely). But given the standard NFL calendar, the season is simply done.</p> <p>2. Specific Suggestions for Improvement (Looking Ahead to Next Season / Offseason):</p> <p>Since the season is likely concluded, your focus should shift to the offseason and preparation for the 2025 season.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Review Your 2024 Season:</p> <ul> <li>Overall Performance: How did you finish in the league (e.g., did you make playoffs? win a championship?)? This will tell you if your core strategy worked.</li> <li>Player Consistency: Identify which players were consistent producers vs. boom-or-bust options.</li> <li>Draft Hits &amp; Misses: Learn from your draft picks. Who exceeded expectations? Who disappointed?</li> <li>Waiver Wire/Trade Success: Evaluate your in-season moves.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Keeper/Dynasty Considerations (if applicable to your league):</p> <ul> <li>Strong Core: You have excellent young talent with CeeDee Lamb, Puka Nacua, Trey McBride, and potentially Jordan Love. These are prime keeper/dynasty assets.</li> <li>Veteran Value: DK Metcalf and D'Andre Swift are solid, but evaluate their long-term outlook vs. their cost if you have keeper penalties.</li> <li>Rookies/Sleepers: Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Ty Chandler, and Blake Corum (if he was a late-season stash/rookie draft pick) are players with potential for growth.</li> <li>Defensive Players (DP/D_ST): Zaire Franklin, Maxx Crosby, Aidan Hutchinson, and Brian Branch are all strong IDP options. If your league uses individual defensive players (which the DP slot and IDP scoring rules suggest), assess their year-end production. Chiefs D/ST is typically reliable.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Offseason Research:</p> <ul> <li>NFL Free Agency: Monitor player movement. A player changing teams can drastically alter their fantasy value (e.g., Swift to Bears, or a QB getting a new WR).</li> <li>NFL Draft: Identify promising rookies. With your roster, you might target a strong RB or a complementary WR depending on your keeper choices.</li> <li>Team Depth: Analyze positions where you lacked depth or where injuries hurt you the most.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>3. Identify Any Underperforming Players (Season-Long Perspective, not Week 22):</p> <p>As mentioned, no one \"underperformed\" in Week 22 because no one played. To identify underperformers over the entire season, I would need their full season stats and your expectations for them. However, based on general fantasy consensus and your roster:</p> <ul> <li>Jaxon Smith-Njigba: While he showed flashes, his rookie year (2023) was often overshadowed by Lockett and Metcalf. His future is bright, but his 2024 performance might have been considered \"under\" expectations by some owners, especially in a PPR league with his talent. If he didn't consistently produce, he could be an underperformer relative to his draft capital.</li> <li>Drake London: Another talented receiver who has often been held back by QB play and offensive scheme. If he wasn't a consistent WR\u2154 for you, he might have been an underperformer based on his potential.</li> <li>Brian Robinson Jr. / Jaylen Warren / Ty Chandler: These RBs often live in committees. If they didn't get enough volume to be reliable starters for you, they might be considered underperformers compared to their potential or what you hoped for when drafting them.</li> </ul> <p>4. Suggest Potential Strategies for the Upcoming Weeks (Shifting to Next Season):</p> <ul> <li>Post-Season Analysis: Take the time to look at your league's final standings. Identify top-scoring teams and analyze their roster construction. What strategies worked for others?</li> <li>Rule Changes/Discussions: If your league holds discussions about potential rule changes for the next season (e.g., keeper rules, scoring adjustments), participate actively to shape the league in your favor.</li> <li>Mock Drafts (Closer to next season): As the NFL draft and free agency unfold, start doing mock drafts to gauge player values and identify targets.</li> <li>Maintain Your Core: Your team has a strong foundation with CeeDee Lamb, Puka Nacua, and Trey McBride. These are cornerstone pieces to build around. Jordan Love also emerged as a solid QB.</li> <li>Address Running Back Depth: While Swift is good, having more consistent RB options is always key. This will be a primary focus for your next draft or offseason trades.</li> <li>Leverage IDP: With strong IDP players like Franklin, Crosby, Hutchinson, and Branch, make sure you're maximizing their value in your lineup each week. In leagues with DPs, these players can provide a significant advantage if managed well.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, don't worry about the 0.00 score for Week 22. Use this time to reflect on the 2024 season and start preparing for a successful 2025 campaign!</p>","tags":["fantasy-football","analysis","2025-season"]},{"location":"reports/2025/08/23/fantasy-football-analysis-2025-08-23/#next-game-analysis","title":"Next Game Analysis","text":"<p>Let's break down this upcoming fantasy football matchup in the San Cola Cup Covid Years league.

You should absolutely start DK Metcalf here. He's a locked-in WR\u00bd with immense upside.</li> <li>WR_TE Flex: Another prime spot for your WR depth.

Based on recent trends and potential volume, London might be slightly safer, but JSN has shown explosive play capability. Look for matchup strength.</li> <li>IDP Strategy: You have four excellent IDP players (Franklin, Crosby, Hutchinson, Branch) for two spots. You should definitely start Franklin and Crosby. For the bench, Hutchinson is another elite pass rusher, and Branch is a high-volume tackler in the secondary. Keep Hutchinson on the bench for injury or if a specific matchup for Crosby/Franklin is terrible (unlikely).</li> </ul> <p>Waiver Wire Pickups (Consider for long-term depth or specific matchups):</p> <ul> <li>High-Volume Tackling LBs/Safeties: Given the IDP scoring, always look for players averaging 8+ combined tackles. Even if your starters are locked, depth is key.</li> <li>Pass Rushers: If there's an active DE/OLB with a good matchup available, they could be worth stashing, especially as your current pass rushers are elite.</li> <li>Return Specialists: While you don't appear to have one on your roster, your opponent does (KaVontae Turpin). With 1 point per 25 return yards, this is a hidden source of points. Keep an eye on any bench players or waiver wire options who get significant punt/kickoff return duties and could be viable flex plays in a pinch.</li> <li>Handcuff RBs: Your opponent's RBs (CMC, Gibbs) are crucial. Keep an eye on their handcuffs (if available) or even your own (Jaylen Warren for Swift/BRob) for future insurance.</li> </ul> <p>Trade Targets:</p> <ul> <li>Upgrade at RB: This is your most pressing need. Your WR depth is a massive trade asset. Consider packaging one of your deeper WRs (e.g., DK Metcalf or Drake London) with a bench RB (e.g., Brian Robinson Jr. or Jaylen Warren) to try and acquire a higher-end RB2 or even one of your opponent's RBs like Javonte Williams if they're willing to move him for WR help. Your opponent has a surplus of RBs; try to exploit that.</li> <li>Another Top-Tier IDP: While you're strong, consolidating another elite IDP if the opportunity arises wouldn't hurt, especially if it means giving up a bench player you don't foresee starting.</li> </ul>","tags":["fantasy-football","analysis","2025-season"]},{"location":"reports/2025/08/23/fantasy-football-analysis-2025-08-23/#4-identify-overperforming-or-underperforming-players","title":"4.

Strategic Suggestions to Win the Game","text":"<p>Given the opponent's strong RB room and high team average, you'll need to maximize your own strengths and look for every edge.</p> <p>A. Lineup Optimization:</p> <ul> <li>Prioritize WRs in Flex: Your strongest position is WR. You have CeeDee Lamb, Puka Nacua, DK Metcalf, Drake London, Jaxon Smith-Njigba. With 2 WR spots, 1 RB/WR, and 1 WR/TE, you can start up to 4-5 WRs.<ul> <li>WR: CeeDee Lamb, Puka Nacua (Must-starts)</li> <li>RB: D'Andre Swift (Must-start)</li> <li>RB/WR Flex: This is where it gets interesting. Given your RB depth is weaker than your WR depth, you should strongly consider starting DK Metcalf here, unless a specific RB has an exceptional matchup.</li> <li>WR/TE Flex: Trey McBride is a solid TE option. However, if you have a fourth WR with a great matchup (e.g., Drake London or Jaxon Smith-Njigba) and McBride's matchup is poor, consider pivoting to the WR, especially given 0.5 PPR.</li> <li>IDP (DP): You have Zaire Franklin (LB), Maxx Crosby (DE), Aidan Hutchinson (DE), Brian Branch (DB). You need to pick two.<ul> <li>Zaire Franklin is a high-floor tackle machine. He should be one of your two DP starters.</li> <li>For the second spot, consider the weekly matchups and potential for big plays (FF, FR, INT, Stuffs, PD). Maxx Crosby and Aidan Hutchinson are elite. Brian Branch is also good for tackles/PD. Crosby/Hutchinson might have higher upside for disruption, while Branch offers a good tackle floor.</li> </ul> </li> <li>K &amp; D/ST: Cairo Santos and Chiefs D/ST. Ensure the Chiefs D/ST isn't facing an elite offense that could lead to negative points. Given the extreme D/ST scoring, if the Chiefs have a bad matchup, consider streaming.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>B. Waiver Wire Pickups:</p> <ul> <li>RB Depth: Monitor news for any RBs with increased workload due to injury or favorable matchups. Your RB room is a weakness; finding a high-upside plug-and-play RB would be ideal. Look for any RBs with a potential for a lead role due to unexpected depth chart changes.</li> <li>IDP Matchups: Given you have strong IDP depth but only two spots, use the waiver wire to find players with exceptionally good weekly matchups if one of your starters has a poor one. Look for LBs playing against run-heavy teams or teams that throw a lot to their RBs/TEs (more tackles). Safeties against pass-heavy teams (more passes defensed/INT opportunities).</li> <li>Kicker/D/ST Stream: The D/ST scoring is very volatile. If the Chiefs D/ST is facing an elite offense that historically puts up a lot of points/yards, strongly consider streaming a D/ST playing a weak offense or a low-scoring game. The potential for negative points is high.</li> </ul> <p>C. Trade Targets:</p> <ul> <li>Your Biggest Need: RB. You have a surplus of good WRs.<ul> <li>Trade Out: Consider trading DK Metcalf, Drake London, or Jaxon Smith-Njigba for an upgrade at RB. You have enough WR talent to still field a strong lineup even after trading one.</li> <li>Trade In: Target a reliable RB2. Your opponent has Christian McCaffrey, Jahmyr Gibbs, and Javonte Williams. They might be open to trading Javonte Williams if they need WR depth, which could be a fantastic acquisition for you. Other potential targets could be RBs on teams with less WR depth.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["fantasy-football","analysis","2025-season"]},{"location":"reports/2025/08/24/fantasy-football-analysis-2025-08-24/#4-overperforming-or-underperforming-players-based-on-season-averages","title":"4.

A high average implies he's hit his boom weeks regularly.</li> <li>Cooper Kupp: Elite when healthy, but if his average is high, he's likely healthy and performing at the top of his game, which can be inconsistent.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Potentially Underperforming (relative to their own ceiling or past production):<ul> <li>Javonte Williams: While good, he's often in a committee and recovering from injury. His average might be lower than his potential if he were the clear lead back.</li> <li>Hollywood Brown: Has high upside but often struggles with consistency and target share.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Overall Outlook:</p> <p>Your opponent has a high-scoring roster, particularly at RB. You will need your elite WRs and strong IDPs to deliver top-tier performances to overcome this. Focus on maximizing your lineup by potentially starting more WRs in flex spots and carefully picking your two IDPs based on weekly matchups. The D/ST volatility is a swing factor that could benefit either team depending on the week's matchups.
