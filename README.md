# :football: Fantasy Football AI :robot:

> Using AI to dominate your fantasy football league. It's like having a secret weapon, but for nerds.

This project leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to provide data-driven insights and analysis for your fantasy football league. It helps you make informed decisions on player stats, team analysis, and trade suggestions.

## :sparkles: Features

*   **Player Stat Analysis**: Downloads and processes weekly player statistics from the `nfl_data_py` library.
*   **Customizable Scoring Rules**: Define your league's scoring rules in `config.yaml` for accurate fantasy point calculations.
*   **Report Generation**: Generates comprehensive Markdown reports summarizing draft recommendations, bye week conflicts, and trade suggestions.
*   **Team Analysis**: Uses the Gemini AI to analyze your team's roster and provide feedback.
*   **Trade Suggestions**: Identifies "buy-low" and "sell-high" trade candidates based on weekly performance versus season averages.
*   **Available Player Downloads**: Fetches a list of all available players from your ESPN league.
*   **League Settings**: Downloads your current league settings, including scoring and roster rules.
*   **Customizable Tasks**: Uses `Taskfile` to easily run common commands for linting, installing dependencies, downloading data, and running analysis.

## :rocket: Getting Started

### :hammer_and_wrench: Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nicholaswilde/fantasy-football-ai.git
    cd fantasy-football-ai
    ```

2.  **Install `task`:**
    Follow the instructions at [taskfile.dev/installation](https://taskfile.dev/installation) to install `task`.

3.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    task bootstrap
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    task deps
    ```

### :gear: Configuration

To use the Gemini API, you need to configure your API key. To get your fantasy football team, you need to configure your ESPN credentials. Additionally, you can customize your league's scoring rules.

1.  Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

2.  Find your `LEAGUE_ID` from the URL of your ESPN fantasy football league.

3.  Find your `ESPN_S2` and `SWID` cookies from your browser after logging into your ESPN account. See [this discussion][1].

4.  Create a `.env` file from the template:
    ```bash
    cp .env.tmpl .env
    ```

5.  Add your API key and ESPN credentials to the `.env` file:

6. Specify Gemini AI model:

    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    LEAGUE_ID="YOUR_LEAGUE_ID"
    ESPN_S2="YOUR_ESPN_S2"
    SWID="YOUR_SWID"
    GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"
    ```

7.  **Customize Scoring Rules (Optional)**:
    The project includes a `config.yaml` file in the root directory. You can modify this file to adjust the fantasy football scoring rules to match your league's settings. This allows for flexible customization without changing the Python code.

    ```yaml
    # config.yaml example
    scoring_rules:
        passing_yards: 0.04
        passing_touchdowns: 6
        # ... other scoring rules
    ```

## :computer: Usage

This project uses `Taskfile.yml` to define and run tasks. You can see a list of all available tasks by running `task -l`.

### :arrow_down: Download Player Stats

To download the latest player stats (defaulting to the 2023 and 2024 seasons), run the following command:

```bash
task download
```

You can also specify the years to download by passing the `--years` argument:

```bash
task download -- --years 2022 2023
```

This will create a `player_stats.csv` file in the `data/` directory.

### :clipboard: Download Available Players

To get a list of available players for weekly pickups, run the following command:

```bash
task available_players
```

This will create an `available_players.csv` file in the `data/` directory.

### :bar_chart: Analyze Your Team

1.  Get your team's roster and create the `my_team.md` file by running the following command:
    ```bash
    task my_team
    ```

2.  Run the analysis script:
    ```bash
    task analyze
    ```

### :page_with_curl: Generate Report

To generate a comprehensive report with draft recommendations, bye week analysis, and trade suggestions, run:

```bash
task report
```

This will create a `report.md` file in the `reports/` directory.

### :art: Render Report

To render the generated Markdown report (`reports/report.md`) to an HTML file and open it in your default web browser, run:

```bash
task render_report
```

This will create a `report.html` file in the `reports/` directory and automatically open it.

### :globe_with_meridians: Publishing Reports

Reports generated by the AI can be published to the MkDocs Material site. This allows for easy sharing and viewing of the analysis.

To publish a report, ensure it is located in the `docs/blog/posts/` directory with the correct YAML front matter. The MkDocs site will automatically include it as a blog post.

To build and serve the documentation site locally, run:

```bash
task docs
```

To deploy the documentation site, run:

```bash
task deploy_docs
```

### :gear: Download League Settings

To download your league's settings, run the following command:

```bash
task settings
```

### :mag_right: Get Pickup Recommendations

To get pickup recommendations based on available players, their performance, and your team's needs, run:

```bash
task pickup
```

### :handshake: Get Trade Suggestions

To get trade suggestions based on the latest player stats, run:

```bash
task trade
```
