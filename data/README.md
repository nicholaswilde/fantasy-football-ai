# Data Directory

This directory contains the raw and processed data used for fantasy football analysis.

**player_stats.csv**
 * **Description**: This file stores player statistics for multiple NFL seasons. The data is aggregated on a per-player, per-season basis and includes a wide range of metrics for offensive players. This data is utilized by `scripts/analysis.py` and `scripts/generate_report.py` for fantasy point calculations and report generation.
 * **Source**: The data is downloaded programmatically using the `nfl_data_py` Python library, which pulls from various sources including the nflverse project.
 * **Update**: This file is generated by running the `scripts/download_stats.py` script. It is intentionally excluded from version control via the `.gitignore` file to prevent the repository from becoming too large.

**Scoring Rules**
 * **Location**: The scoring rules used for fantasy point calculations are now externalized in `config.yaml` in the project root directory. This allows for easy modification of scoring settings without altering the Python code.
