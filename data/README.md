# Data Files

This directory contains the following data files, which are crucial for the Fantasy Football AI's analysis and operations:

*   `available_players.csv`: This CSV file stores a snapshot of players currently available in your ESPN fantasy football league (i.e., not on any team's roster). It is generated by the `get_available_players.py` script and is used by the `pickup_suggester.py` script to recommend waiver wire pickups.

*   `last_updated.log`: A simple log file that records the timestamp of the last successful update of the `player_stats.csv` file. This helps in tracking data freshness.

*   `my_team.md`: This Markdown file contains your current fantasy football team roster, fetched directly from your ESPN league. It is generated by the `get_my_team.py` script and is used by various analysis scripts to understand your team's strengths and weaknesses.

*   `my_team.md.tmpl`: This is a template file for `my_team.md`. It provides a structural example for how the `my_team.md` file should be formatted, especially useful if you need to manually create or modify your team roster file.

*   `player_adp.csv`: This CSV file contains Average Draft Position (ADP) data for players. ADP is a key metric in fantasy football, indicating where players are typically drafted in leagues. It is used by the `draft_strategizer.py` script to assist in draft decision-making.

*   `player_projections.csv`: This CSV file holds projected fantasy points for players. These projections are estimates of future performance and are used in various analytical models, including Value-Based Drafting (VBD) calculations in `draft_strategizer.py`.

*   `player_stats.csv`: This comprehensive CSV file contains weekly NFL player statistics. It is the primary data source for calculating fantasy points, analyzing player consistency, and identifying trade candidates. It is generated by the `download_stats.py` script.

*   `README.md`: This file itself, providing documentation for the contents of the `data/` directory.
