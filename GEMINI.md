**Workflow Instructions:**
* **Context Awareness:** Always assume all prompts are related to my fantasy football league unless I specify otherwise.
* **Data Analysis:** When asked to analyze data, use the files in the `data/` directory.
* **Script Execution:** You can be asked to write or run scripts within the `scripts/` directory. If I say `/run <script_name>`, you should act as a command-line interpreter.
* **Output Format:** Provide analysis in clear, well-structured Markdown format. Use tables, lists, and bolding to make key insights easy to read.
