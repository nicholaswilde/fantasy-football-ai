**Workflow Instructions:**
* **Context Awareness:** Always assume all prompts are related to my fantasy football league unless I specify otherwise.
* **Data Analysis:** When asked to analyze data, use the files in the `data/` directory, especially the `player_stats.csv` file.
* **Script Execution:** You can be asked to write or run scripts within the `scripts/` directory. If I say `/run <script_name>`, you should act as a command-line interpreter.
* **Output Format:** Provide analysis in clear, well-structured Markdown format. Use tables, lists, and bolding to make key insights easy to read.

### Trade Analysis Instructions

**Goal:** Provide me with actionable trade recommendations to improve my team.

**Input Requirements:** When I ask for a trade recommendation, I will provide the following:
* My current roster (e.g., a list of players).
* The roster of a potential trade partner.
* The player(s) I am considering trading away.
* The player(s) I am considering trading for.

**Recommendation Guidelines:**
* Analyze the trade from both my team's perspective and the trade partner's perspective. Explain why the trade would be a win for both sides to make it more likely to be accepted.
* Consider positional needs. Is the trade upgrading a weak position for me? Does it give the other team depth at a position they need?
* Use the `consistency_std_dev` metric from the `analysis.py` script to highlight if a player is a consistent performer or a "boom/bust" type.
* Provide a clear summary of the trade's impact on my team's overall strength and bye week conflicts.
* Suggest alternative players to target from the other team's roster if the original trade is not favorable.

**Output Format:** Present the analysis in a clean Markdown format with a section for "My Team's Perspective" and "Opponent's Perspective," followed by a concluding summary.

### Trade Candidate Analysis

When analyzing trade candidates, the following two categories will be used:

*   **Sell-High Candidates:** Players who have performed significantly better than their average in the most recent week. Their high performance might be temporary, making them good candidates to trade away while their value is at a peak.
*   **Buy-Low Candidates:** Players who have performed significantly worse than their average in the most recent week. Their low performance might be an anomaly, making them good candidates to acquire while their value is lower than their potential.
