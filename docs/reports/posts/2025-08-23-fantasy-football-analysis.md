### Team Strengths and Weaknesses

This analysis compares your team's Value Over Replacement (VOR) at each position against the league average for top-tier players. A positive difference means your players at that position are, on average, more valuable than the league's top players.

**ðŸ’ª Strongest Position:** Your **SS** group is your team's biggest strength.

**ðŸ¤” Area for Improvement:** Your **RB** group is the most immediate area to upgrade. Consider targeting players at this position.

## Last Game Analysis

It looks like there might be a misunderstanding regarding the timing of Week 22 in the NFL season, which directly impacts your team's fantasy performance.

The NFL regular season typically concludes after Week 18, followed by the playoffs (Wild Card, Divisional, Conference Championships, and Super Bowl). **Fantasy football leagues generally conclude their regular season by Week 17 or 18 at the latest, with many championship games held in Week 17.**

Therefore, "Week 22 of the 2024 season" for fantasy football does not exist in the traditional sense, as there are no regular season games being played where fantasy points would be accumulated. This is why your team scored 0.00 points and "No individual player stats were found" for your team this week â€“ there simply weren't any active games for your players to participate in for fantasy scoring purposes.

Let's address your questions based on this understanding:

---

1.  **An evaluation of my team's performance in Week 22. Did I do well or poorly, and why?**

    Your team performed **poorly** in Week 22, scoring 0.00 points. However, this is not a reflection of your players' actual talent or your management skills. The reason for the 0.00 score is that **the NFL regular season (and thus the fantasy football scoring period) has concluded long before Week 22.** There were no fantasy-relevant games played by your players during this period.

2.  **Specific suggestions for improvement, considering potential waiver wire pickups, trade targets, or lineup adjustments.**

    At "Week 22" of the NFL calendar, there are no active waiver wires, trade deadlines, or lineup adjustments to be made for the current fantasy season. All fantasy leagues would have concluded.

    However, if we are looking forward to the **next fantasy season (2025)**, here are some general thoughts on your roster:

    *   **Quarterback:** Jordan Love had a breakout 2024 season. He's a strong starting QB for next year.
    *   **Running Backs:** Swift had a solid year but might be a free agent. Robinson Jr., Warren, Chandler, and Corum provide depth, but consistent high-end production might be an issue depending on how next season shakes out.
    *   **Tight End:** Trey McBride emerged as a top-tier TE. Excellent asset.
    *   **Wide Receivers:** Lamb and Nacua are elite, top-tier WR1s. DK Metcalf is a good starter but can be streaky. London and Smith-Njigba have high potential but need more consistent opportunities/target shares. Meyers is a decent depth piece.
    *   **Defense/Special Teams:** The Chiefs D is generally reliable.
    *   **IDP (if your league plays with them):** Zaire Franklin, Maxx Crosby, Aidan Hutchinson are all strong performers in IDP leagues. Brian Branch is a solid young safety.

    **Waiver Wire/Trade Targets (for the *next* season's draft/early waivers):** Your core WRs (Lamb, Nacua), TE (McBride), and QB (Love) are excellent building blocks. You might look to bolster your RB room through the draft or early season waivers, depending on Swift's situation and the usage of your other RBs.

3.  **Identify any underperforming players on my team.**

    For "Week 22," **all players underperformed** by scoring 0.00 points, but this is solely because the fantasy season was over. It is not an indictment of their actual performance during the 2024 NFL regular season.

    To properly identify underperforming players, we would need to look at their season-long statistics compared to their draft capital or expectations. Based on typical 2024 season expectations:
    *   **Drake London and Jaxon Smith-Njigba** both had flashes of brilliance but didn't consistently deliver elite fantasy numbers, likely due to team offense and target competition. They have high potential for the future, but their 2024 output might have felt a bit "under" expectations for some.
    *   **DK Metcalf** was good but sometimes inconsistent, though still a valuable starter.
    *   Your RB depth (Robinson, Warren, Chandler, Corum) showed promise but might not have been week-to-week locks for high production, depending on the specific game scripts and situations.

4.  **Suggest potential strategies for the upcoming weeks.**

    Since the 2024 fantasy football season is over, your focus should shift entirely to **offseason preparation for the 2025 season.**

    *   **Review Your 2024 Season:**
        *   Analyze your team's strengths and weaknesses throughout the *actual* scoring weeks.
        *   Which players were consistent? Which were boom-or-bust?
        *   Identify positions where you consistently struggled to find a reliable starter.

    *   **Keeper/Dynasty Considerations (if applicable):**
        *   Evaluate your core players (Lamb, Nacua, Love, McBride, Swift if he re-signs somewhere favorable) as potential keepers for 2025.
        *   In dynasty, assess the long-term value of your younger players like Corum, London, Smith-Njigba, and Branch.

    *   **Stay Informed on Offseason News:**
        *   **Free Agency:** Keep an eye on where key players land, especially your own (e.g., D'Andre Swift). Player movement can drastically change roles and fantasy value.
        *   **NFL Draft:** Pay attention to which teams draft quarterbacks, running backs, and receivers, as this directly impacts the value of existing players on those teams and introduces new fantasy-relevant talent.
        *   **Coaching Changes:** New offensive coordinators can lead to significant shifts in play-calling and player usage.

    *   **Pre-Draft Research:** Begin compiling your rankings and targets for the 2025 draft, even if it's just early thoughts based on 2024 performance and projected offseason changes.

Essentially, for "upcoming weeks" (which means the next *fantasy season*), your strategy should be to become a knowledgeable participant in the NFL offseason to best position yourself for success in 2025.
