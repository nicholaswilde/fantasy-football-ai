### Team Strengths and Weaknesses

This analysis compares your team's Value Over Replacement (VOR) at each position against the league average for top-tier players. A positive difference means your players at that position are, on average, more valuable than the league's top players.

**ðŸ’ª Strongest Position:** Your **SS** group is your team's biggest strength.

**ðŸ¤” Area for Improvement:** Your **RB** group is the most immediate area to upgrade. Consider targeting players at this position.

## Last Game Analysis

It appears there might be a misunderstanding regarding the timing of Week 22 in the context of the NFL season.

The NFL regular season typically concludes around Week 18, with the playoffs and Super Bowl finishing in late January or early February of the following calendar year. **Week 22 of the 2024 fantasy football season would correspond to late February or early March 2025 in the real world.** At this point, the NFL season is completely over, and all players are in their offseason.

This is why your team scored 0.00 points and no individual player stats were found â€“ no NFL games are being played.

Let's address your points based on this understanding:

---

### 1. Evaluation of Your Team's Performance in Week 22

**Did I do well or poorly, and why?**

You scored **0.00 points**, which is, by definition, the lowest possible score and therefore **extremely poorly** in terms of actual points.

**However, this is not a reflection of your team's quality or your management.** The reason for the 0.00 points is that the NFL season is over. No players are playing games, and thus no players are accumulating fantasy points. Every team in your league would have scored 0.00 points this week.

---

### 2. Specific Suggestions for Improvement (Waiver Wire, Trade Targets, Lineup Adjustments)

Given that the season is over, immediate waiver wire pickups, trade targets, or lineup adjustments are **irrelevant for current scoring**. These actions are for *next season*.

However, this is an excellent time for **offseason planning:**

*   **Waiver Wire:** Start looking at undrafted free agents, potential breakout candidates for next season, or players who finished strong but might be overlooked. Monitor NFL free agency and draft results closely to see which players land in favorable situations.
*   **Trade Targets:** Evaluate your roster's strengths and weaknesses.
    *   **Strengths:** You have a solid core of receivers (Lamb, Nacua, Metcalf) and a decent QB (Love showed promise). McBride is a good young TE.
    *   **Weaknesses (potentially):** RB depth could be a concern long-term with Swift, Robinson, Warren, Chandler, and Corum â€“ assess who might break out or who to target for more consistent production. You have a lot of good, but not necessarily elite, options.
    *   Consider trading high-value players for future draft capital or to address a specific positional need if you foresee an overabundance in one area.
*   **Lineup Adjustments:** You can't make any for Week 22. For *next season*, your current roster suggests you have good depth at WR. Ensure you're playing the best matchups and keeping an eye on injuries.

---

### 3. Identify Any Underperforming Players on My Team

**No player on your team is "underperforming" in Week 22.** As explained, the NFL season is over, so no one is expected to score points.

From a season-long perspective (assuming the 2024 season you just finished), you would need their actual season stats to determine underperformers. However, looking at your roster:

*   **Cairo Santos:** Kickers are often inconsistent, and while he might have had good weeks, he's unlikely to be an "elite" asset.
*   **Brian Robinson Jr., Jaylen Warren, Ty Chandler, Blake Corum:** These RBs likely had varying degrees of success. Some might have been "underperforming" their draft capital or expectations, while others might have exceeded them.
*   **Drake London, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Jakobi Meyers:** These receivers often battle for targets and consistency. If their target share was low or their production was inconsistent, they might be considered underperformers relative to their potential.

But again, for **Week 22**, no one underperformed.

---

### 4. Suggest Potential Strategies for the Upcoming Weeks (i.e., the Offseason leading into the 2025 Season)

Since "upcoming weeks" means the offseason leading into the 2025 season, here are crucial strategies:

1.  **Roster Review & Keeper Decisions (if applicable):**
    *   Go through every player on your roster. Which players are keepers? Which players are on expiring contracts? Which players are good enough to roster through the offseason?
    *   Identify players who have breakout potential for 2025 (e.g., Blake Corum might have a bigger role, Jaxon Smith-Njigba could take a step forward).
    *   Assess the age and injury history of your players.

2.  **Monitor NFL Offseason News Religiously:**
    *   **Free Agency:** Which players sign with new teams? This can drastically change their fantasy value (e.g., a productive RB going to a crowded backfield, or a WR landing as a clear #1).
    *   **NFL Draft:** Pay close attention to rookie RBs, WRs, and QBs, and where they are drafted. Landing spot and draft capital are huge indicators of potential immediate impact. Blake Corum's situation (if you drafted him as a rookie in 2024) will be interesting to watch for 2025.
    *   **Coaching Changes:** New offensive coordinators can completely change a team's scheme and player usage.
    *   **Injuries:** Keep track of players recovering from significant injuries.

3.  **Study Your League Settings:**
    *   Review scoring rules (PPR, Half-PPR, Standard) and make sure you understand them for next season's draft and roster construction.
    *   Are there changes to roster size, IR spots, or playoff format?
    *   What is your league's draft order for 2025?

4.  **Engage with the League (Strategically):**
    *   Gauge your leaguemates' interest in trading future draft picks or players.
    *   Discuss potential rules changes or improvements for the league.
    *   Stay active in the league chat to keep your mind in fantasy mode.

5.  **Research & Prospecting:**
    *   Start compiling rankings for the 2025 season as new information comes out.
    *   Read up on dynasty and redraft strategies.
    *   Look at breakout and bust candidates for the upcoming year.

Essentially, your current task is to shift from in-season management to full offseason preparation mode, leveraging the next several months to build an even stronger team for the 2025 San Cola Cup Covid Years league.
