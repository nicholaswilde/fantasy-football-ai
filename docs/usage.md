# :computer: Usage

This project uses `Taskfile.yml` to define and run tasks. You can see a list of all available tasks by running `task -l`.

### :arrow_down: Download Player Stats

To download the latest player stats (defaulting to the 2023 and 2024 seasons), run the following command:

```bash
task download
```

You can also specify the years to download by passing the `--years` argument:

```bash
task download -- --years 2022 2023
```

This will create a `player_stats.csv` file in the `data/` directory.

### :clipboard: Download Available Players

To get a list of available players for weekly pickups, run the following command:

```bash
task available_players
```

This will create an `available_players.csv` file in the `data/` directory.

### :bust_in_silhouette: Identify Your Team

To select your team from a list of all teams in the league, run the following command:

```bash
task identify_team
```

You will be prompted to enter the number corresponding to your team from the list. This will save your team's ID to the `my_team_id` field in the `config.yaml` file, so the other scripts know which team is yours.

### :bar_chart: Analyze Your Team

To get your team's roster and create the `my_team.md` file, run the following command:
```bash
task my_team
```

### :page_with_curl: Generate Report

To generate a comprehensive report with draft recommendations, bye week analysis, and trade suggestions, run:

```bash
task report
```

This will create a Markdown report file in the `docs/reports/posts/` directory, suitable for publishing with MkDocs.

### :computer: View Report in Terminal

To view the generated report directly in your terminal, run:

```bash
task report_terminal
```

This will output the same comprehensive analysis to your command line, formatted for readability.

### :art: Render Report

To render the generated Markdown report (`reports/report.md`) to an HTML file and open it in your default web browser, run:

```bash
task render_report
```

This will create a `report.html` file in the `reports/` directory and automatically open it.

### :globe_with_meridians: Publishing Reports

Reports generated by the AI can be published to the MkDocs Material site. This allows for easy sharing and viewing of the analysis.

To publish a report, ensure it is located in the `docs/blog/posts/` directory with the correct YAML front matter. The MkDocs site will automatically include it as a blog post.

To build and serve the documentation site locally, run:

```bash
task docs
```



### :gear: Download League Settings

To download your league's settings, run the following command:

```bash
task settings
```

### :mag_right: Get Pickup Recommendations
